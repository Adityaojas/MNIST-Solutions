This approach uses a custom multilayered neural network with custom built backpropagation algorithm from scratch. 
The approach is not optimized so a subset of MNIST dataset has been used to fasten the learning.
The module 'mymodule' contains the Classes used in the approach, including a simple preprocessing step, dataset loading, and the NeuralNetwork Class.
